### **How did you organize the team? Which tools did you use, if any?**
We organized the team using Discord for communication. 
Google Docs and Google Drive were used to help with collaboration.
Work for Sprint 0 was divided equally among the team members.

**Roles:** 
* Product owner: David Tan
* Developers: Everyone
* Testers: 
Everyone. Each developer tests their own code before committing to the dev repo.
* Domain experts: 
MongoDB and Express team advisor (Lawrence Cai)
* Scrum master: (Our TA)

### **How did you make decisions?**
We made decisions by having individual members make proposals during meetings. Everyone would listen to the proposal in full. Afterwards, team members would have the opportunity to address any concerns. Concerns were negotiated until any objecting team members were satisfied. If making decisions or addressing concerns were to take too long, we would instead leave it up to a majority vote. 

### **How did you define priority and/or points of user stories?**
We defined the point scale of user stories using a modified fibonacci series. A user story can have points: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100. Where a user story with a point of 1 will take approximately 30 minutes or less and each point in the series will take approximately double the time of the preceding point in the series.

We defined the priority of user stories based on the following criteria:
* How essential they are to the key personas; entrepreneur (Yusuf Ali), instructor (Jane Doe), and partner (Victor Otieno). 
* Order of precedence for persona user stories: Entrepreneur, Instructor, Partner
* Is this user story a core requirement for the platform to satisfy the customer needs.

### **How frequently did you meet?**
As a team we met every two days to discuss what has progressed and any concerns to plan out. We assigned any tasks for the week here and discussed any requirements for collaboration that would need to occur over the week. Regular meetings will occur every Monday and Friday and more meetings may be created when needed. 

### **What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?**
Going into the next phase, we will begin having daily stand-ups to update team members on sprint progress. During meetings, we will allocate larger tasks to people and use estimates of how long it will take to complete a task in order to prevent the majority of work from being done near the deadline. 

When we worked on our different sections we didnâ€™t look too closely at the rubric and structure of what needed to be done which led to confusion and missing out on work which only was resolved when we reviewed the sections at the end. In future phases we will ensure each member has taken a detailed look at the rubric and description of their given section
