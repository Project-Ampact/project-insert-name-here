## Overview
Create a MVP for managing the African Impact Challenge, a platform that helps aspiring entrepreneurs in Africa to solve their country’s challenges using technology. The web application will allow for profile creations that help the user set up a company and also allow them to message and connect with other users. There will also be a dedicated e-learning platform which will guide the user to bringing their solutions to life through pre-recorded content, deliverables, calendar scheduling and live workshops/sessions.

## Key Personas
* **Entrepreneur:** Twenty-three year-old Yusuf Ali is an aspiring entrepreneur from Kenya. He wants to learn more about entrepreneurship while networking with other entrepreneurs, potential mentors and investors.
* **Company owner:** Victor Otieno, 35,  is the owner of MarketKenya, a growing digital marketing company that provides marketing solutions for businesses across Kenya. Victor is a ambitious man who gets along well with others and values the importance of teamwork and collaboration
* **Instructor:** Jane Doe is a 36 year old instructor who works remotely where she teaches Marketing content. She wants to deliver course content while also being able to connect with her entrepreneur students easily

## Key Scenarios
* **Entrepreneur:** Yusuf is looking for a platform where he can learn more about entrepreneurship with a flexible schedule because he works part-time during the day. He utilizes the platform every day, so it should be able to keep track of his past work and have all the modules organized sequentially. At the same time he also wants to be able to network with other like-minded entrepreneurs who are in the same mindset as him, so a messaging/discussion feature is crucial. Finally, he would also like to be able to connect with potential mentors and investors.
* **Company Owner:** Victor wants to continue to expand his company. To accomplish this, Victor needs to partner with business owners and entrepreneurs who can help him find new ideas and enter new markets. Unfortunately, Victor lacks a platform where he can uncover and meet these people. What Victor needs is an easy-to-use platform where he can be introduced to and collaborate with other business owners and aspiring entrepreneurs.
* **Instructor:** Jane is working remotely as an Instructor for the African Impact Challenge She uses the online learning platform to upload her teaching content and to talk with her students if they have questions and to connect with them. Although she is an expert in Business and teaching its best practices, she isn’t the most tech savvy. Due to this and also her busy life, she would like the online learning platform to be easy to learn and navigate and minimal in design in order to allow her to efficiently do her work.

## Key Principles
* **Unified experience:** The entrepreneur will have access to learning and the startup community in one place to help bring their ideas to life.
* **Easy to use:** The interface of the website will be appealing and easy to use for all users.
* **Encourage content creation:** Provide the instructor with tools to post prerecorded content (text, video, audio, documents) and also users to communicate their ideas and opinions to others through the discussion board and direct messaging.
