## Notes: 
The virtual pre-recorded content is a part of Linkedin Learning (formerly Linda.com), separate from the organic and guided interaction. 
The e-learning platforms lack strong community and profile systems. They also have no way to add external partners outside of adding them as instructors or students to the course. Groups or companies need to be created manually by an instructor before they can be joined. Our online community competitors do not have strong e-learning tools -- Linkedin Learning has no way of submitting or receiving feedback, or contracting instructors; Slack has no internal learning management tools. 

Our platform will combine guidance from mentors with the means to directly engage with potential investors. It will be fully integrated with a single profile as opposed to spread out between multiple websites. Mentors will also be able to directly share more private information with multiple potential investors at the same time, as opposed to privately contacting each one.  

Other companies do not focus on this use case because they are more closely aimed at education (i.e. Google Classroom, Edmodo, Canvas, Moodle) or at professional connections (i.e. Linkedin and Slack).

Google could branch out towards stronger profiles, but they had previously tried that with Google+ and it was not a successful business venture. Linkedin could more easily branch out here, but that would mean there would need to be a large market for licensing or to change its business model for Linkedin Learning (full employees required to give constant feedback for more synchronous courses).
