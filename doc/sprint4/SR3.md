## Unfinished Tasks
As a entrepreneur, I should be able to submit online assignments/deliverables and see when they are due so that I can submit deliverables on time for feedback and evaluation (independent)
* IN-105: GET request for a user’s assignments
* IN-106: POST request to upload a user’s submissions

## Good Practices (✅)
* Planned the critical path
* Started final documents for submissions earlier
* Made plans around known delays (people getting the covid vaccine or people being busy with other coursework)

## New Practices (✅)
* Finish all code by Friday 3PM 

## Harmful Practices (❌)
* Last minute coding before the deadline.
* Not testing API endpoints thoroughly
* Uploading our finalized work from develop to main in the last 30 minutes before deadline
* Not looking at previous implementations to help solve similar problems

## Best Experience (✅)
* Completing the discussion board from scratch with polished features for posts, comments and replies.

## Worst Experience (❌)
* Last minute bug fixing and uploading stress
